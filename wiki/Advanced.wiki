== API design ==

Main principles that has been used for _axon-guice_ API design is simplicity and flexibility.

All AxonGuiceModule fields and methods has _protected_ modifier, so you can easily create your own variation of this module. 

== CQRS learning curve ==
CQRS approach is not a silver bullet for every project. This approach requires good programmers qualification with good OOP skills (in my opinion - Senior developers level with 5 years experience is a minimum). 

There is also known rule of thumb for project selection when CQRS can be very useful and effective - duration of the project should be at least 5 man-years.
