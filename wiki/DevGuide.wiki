==Developer Guide==
Welcome to the developer documentation of axon-guice project - integration module between Google Guice and Axon Framework.

Current project version is: *1.0.0*

==What are Axon Framework?==
Here is description from Axon Framework authors:

"_Axon is a lightweight framework that helps developers build scalable and extensible applications by addressing these concerns directly in the architecture. This reference guide explains what Axon is, how it can help you and how you can use it._"

==What are axon-guice?==
Axon-Guice is an integration module between [http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/ Google Guice] and [http://www.axonframework.org Axon Framework].

Module provides:
 * Full support of [http://www.axonframework.org/docs/2.0/single.html#introduction 1-8] and [http://www.axonframework.org/docs/2.0/single.html#performance-tuning 10] of original Axon Framework documentation parts (all parts except Spring integration);
 * Fully customizable API - there is no private/final methods & fields;
 * Ability to inject all major Axon Framework components: CommandBus, EventBus, CommandGateway, UnitOfWork, Repository;
 * Option to perform components auto-discovery or specify all of them manually - see [ExtendingAxonGuiceModule];
 * Significant [http://code.google.com/p/axon-guice/source/browse/trunk/src/test/java/com/google/code/axonguice test coverage].

==How did this work?==

There is a three main steps:

1. Carefully read Axon [http://www.axonframework.org/download/ manual] - all Axon features is available with this project

2. Install a Axon-Guice module:
{{{
// auto-discovery of all CQRS/Axon components
install(new AxonGuiceModule("com.mycomp.domain"));
}}}

3. Define your Aggregate Roots, Entities, Commands/Events, Command/Event Handlers, Domain Services, Query Services, Sagas and so on

4. Override specific parts of AxonGuiceModule to meet your production requirements - for example you can use MongoEventStore instead of default FileSystemEventStore.

==Why not just use pure Axon Framework?==

Of course you can... but with Spring Framework only.

==Where i can get it?==

This project is depends on several 3rd party libraries which is required to work. So, _without_ Maven you should manually add actual versions of this 3rd party libraries. Actual list of them can be viewed in _dependencies_ section of [http://code.google.com/p/axon-guice/source/browse/trunk/pom.xml pom.xml].
